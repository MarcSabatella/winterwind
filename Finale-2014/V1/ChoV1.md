## Approach
Generally speaking, my thoughts were to overlook the text, determine the number of simultaneous voices, and to enter the notes as quickly as possible.

This may seem straight forward, but generally regarding Finale 2014 (as well as previous versions) I have many options for quick engraving.

I will stick with simple entry and keyboard shortcuts. The approach will be to enter each voice all at once, for the entire page.


----------

## Specifics

I used the new music wizard and typed in preliminaries. Time from wizard to score: 3.5 min.

Setup of score specifics was a little overwhelming, and getting used to the options was a little cumbersome.

 - I have to initially setup the time signature as 12/8, even though there is a dualism in the left and right hands.
 - Initial note entry will be the left hand only.
 - Most of the voices will be distributed with the right hand (unless otherwise obvious, e.g. 3 line, middle of second measure, l.h.)

### Note Entry
#### Perceived Problems

 1. Cross-staff rhythmic problems exist. The least problematic resolution is by defining where the voices cross staves.
 2. Employing the use of different time-signatures in each staff seems to be a more useful way for this challenge, because the score actually demands it. Instead of "hiding" the voices inside of tuplets or other ways of rhythmic sublimination without sacrificing the dual time signature, I have voted to create (where necessary) different time signatures in the music. So, especially for the beginning bars, the `r.h.` is in common time, and the `l.h.` is in 12/8.
 3. I'm predicting that the default engraving practices of the typesetting engine in Finale will be dismal. colliding voices, clef changes, all of this will mean a lot of tweaking later on.
 4. I am guessing that in the couple of instances where there are voices in different time signatures, I will have to create them in hidden tuplets. There is no way at this point to create a voice in a different time signature.

Beyond this, I will proceed with note entry, and report back.

#### Methodology and Comments
There was at almost every turn in the music some kind of problem to solve with Finale. The only thing that was straight forward were the 12/8 motions in the `l.h.` and the first/last bars of the `r.h.` I had to make sure of the following:

 1. Every time voices split in the music, I had to make sure that the staff that carried it (even if it was cross staff) was the staff that had the same rhythmic structure (i.e. the `voice 2` in measure four contains most rhythmic consistencies with the `r.h.`).
 2. Even if the voices split, I had to make sure the voices didn't contain subliminal differences in timing (such as the `voice 2` in measure 3 in the `r.h.` [which does split staves]).

The way that Finale sets up the page (i.e. dividing it into measures rather than open bars) has led to time after time of frequent bumps in note entry. When I depart from simple entry, if I haven't typed in all the notes I need, it fills the rest of the measure in with rests. This is extremely frustrating when I want to go back and just begin where I left off; I have to delete of the rests and, in a feat of computer acrobatics) find my way back to simple note entry (without somehow igniting the same fury that got to me in the first place).

What was difficult was not note entry *per se* but actually finagling with the menus and various bars of options. There were several moments where I had to go to 'the book' and look up methods of getting things done, because I had no idea how to even accomplish it. Even though I have extensive experience with Finale, this challenge started a rather fascinating 'nightmare scenario' of a challenge.

I want to emphasize the default output of Finale. Therefore I have not take the liberty to attempt the beaming challenges yet. That will probably be when I get to tweaking output in the next couple of stages.
#### Times
Note entry times are described below:

 - `l.h.` 16th note passage - 00:30:00
 - `time signature` changes and formatting - 00:30:00
 - `r.h.` monophonic parts - 00:02:00
 - `l.h.` and `r.h.` polyphony - 2:45:00 (this is mainly because half the time was strugglin to make voice definitions work and so on)
 - reworking 6th measure to revert to 12/8 (instead of 5/4) - 00:30:00
 - Total research time (which probably shouldn't be recorded officially since we are all assuming a general level of expertise) - 1:00:00

#### Final(e) comments
Once more, the spacing is dismal, and the page is mangled. I imagine this is going to be the most time consuming part of the challenge (but I look forward to it).

The next thing to do would be to add articulations and dynamics, slurs, that sort of thing. In addition, pedal indications and hairpins will need to be added.

I am struggling with understanding how to make the last four 16th notes work. I'm going to have to do some digging, and I'm not sure there will be a proper work around, but probably some kind of compromise. I hope I can find the former.
