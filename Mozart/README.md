## Challenge #01 - Chopin/Godowsky

### Mozart
Here's how I approached challenge 1 with Mozart](http://www.mozart.co.uk/) and some of the trials and tribulations along the way.

First, I used my development version of the program, not the commercially available one.   The main difference is that it produces beams which are far less steep than earlier vesrions, as I'm trying to adhere to the recommendations of Elaine Gould in 'Behind Bars'.  An earlier vesrion would have produced beams as steep as the original image; this one doesn't.

I started a new piece in C-major and 4/4 with Mozart's 'Piano solo' template.  I entered a whole bar rest and then a hard page break, so that I could try and reproduce the image on p2 of my tune.

The Piano solo template gives two strands on each substaff of the grand staff, and for convenience I arranged that these had default stems up/down up/down.  [To complete bar 6 I later had to add another strand on the bass staff.]

At various stages throughout the music entry I had to tweak the layout: increasing the spacing of the staves of the grand Staff, and increasing the spacing between systems.  Also Mozart will not tolerate music as 'squashed up' as the original, so I made the font smaller to get two bars to a line on A4 paper (in order to give a better comparison with the original).

Most of the groups of semiquavers on the bass staff were entered as triplets adding to a crotchet, with each triplet quaver split into 2 semiquavers.  They could equally well have been sextuplets of semiquavers.   Quavers on the treble clef were, where appropriate, entered as sxtets adding to a minim.

Mozart will not produce the strange quaver/semiquaver beaming patterns on the bass staff of the original, but I actually think it is clearer for that!  I was gratified to find no problems with beamed groups moving from treble to bass staff with mixed stem directions (as I don't do this very often myself).   I've added all the fingering numbers of the original, though I have no idea what some of them mean when there is more than one number per note.  But than I'm not a pianist.

So let's be honest about problems encountered:
1. Mozart will not allow a clef change within a tuplet.  I must do something about that!  For the moment I have worked round it by moving them slightly.
2. Mozart is not an 'engraving program' per se and doesn't let you override stem lengths (though this is planned for the future).   No one has reported problems with this in 17 years, but this piece forces me to break beams in two places to avoid collisions: one where I would have needed to lengthen the stem, and one where I would have needed to shorten it.
3. The 'a piacere' at the end connects the stems of the cue on the treble clef with those of the full notes on the bass staff.   Mozart wouldn't let me do it as they have the same pitch!  This is a bug!
4. There's a bug in my development version to do with phrase marks bending round beamed groups of notes on both treble and bass staves with mixed stems.  I therefore missed a couple of small phrase marks out.
5. Mozart will not do nested phrase marks within phrase marks both attached to the stem ends of notes.  Again something to work on!
6. As noted above Mozart doesn't like the strangely mixed quaver/semiquaver beams.
7. As noted above Mozart now avoids steep beams, following best practice as outlined by Elaine Gould.  The accompanying horizontal hairpins are therefore entirly appropriate.

And on an optimistic note, I don't think any of the above are show stoppers, and am reasonably content with the overall result, even though I'll take the problems as hints for future developments!
